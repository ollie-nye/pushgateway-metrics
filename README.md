# Prometheus Metrics for Ruby and a Pushgateway

Prometheus is available as a ruby gem for making metrics available on a
`/metrics` endpoint, but if you need a pushgateway as the middle man, there is
more required configuration that isn't easily available. This gem sets
everything up as required, allowing you to increment metrics without worrying
about the fuss of configuring a non-standard use

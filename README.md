# Prometheus Metrics for Ruby and a Pushgateway

Prometheus is available as a ruby gem for making metrics available on a
`/metrics` endpoint, but if you need a pushgateway as the middle man, there is
more required configuration that isn't normally available. This gem sets
everything up as required, allowing you to increment metrics as required
